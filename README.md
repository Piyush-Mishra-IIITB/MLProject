This project implements a production-ready Machine Learning system that predicts student performance (marks) based on study hours and other academic indicators. The solution demonstrates an end-to-end MLOps workflow, including data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, artifact management, containerization, and deployment with a lightweight user interface.

The project showcases how real-world prediction systems are designed, built, deployed, and maintained according to industry standards.
